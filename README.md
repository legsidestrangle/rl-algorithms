Reinforcement learning algorithms.

There are many different variants on the basic ideas of reinforcement learning.
I have implemented some of them, with a focus on linear function approximation.

Extending these algorithms (for example, with nonlinear function approximators such as neural nets) is relatively straightforward once you are familiar with the underlying ideas.

# Contributing

Send me a pull request if you have code to contribute.

Alternatively, raise an issue and provide me with a link to the paper describing the algorithm, and I will read and implement it when I get a chance.
